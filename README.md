# mgs_stimul

This repository consists of two stimulus design codes based on Psychtoolbox and MATLAB. The Retinotopy folder consists of stimulus presentation codes during TMS for the subjects to draw Phosphenes on the screen.
This information is then used for the mgs to create the stimulus specific to the subjects.
