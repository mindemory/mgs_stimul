<Special characters>
Old syntax
\n				Handshake (only once)
`				Reset
[]\r\n			Settings or Command (comma separated values)

New syntax
\r and \n are not necessary and will be ignored; handshake with ! instead of \n to avoid ambiguity in terminal programs
!				Handshake (only once)
`				Reset
()				Unused
<>				Settings (comma separated values)	(will only respond with 0 or 1)
[]				Command (comma separated values)	(will respond with defined complex behavior)
{}				Unused

<System states>
Benchmark:
	state	description
	10		waiting for handshake
	11		received !
	12		sent 'Teensy ready'
	20		(handshake done)-> listening
	31		heard settings
			(Cannot set baudrate here. It does not matter for Teensy anyways.)
			set whether to use Serial.send_now / expected incoming bytes / expected outgoing bytes (discounting the special character '[')
	35		doing settings
	41		heard command (reading)
	45		doing task (writing)
	51		heard reset

Production:
	state	description
	10		waiting for handshake
	11		received !
	12		sent 'Teensy ready'
	20		(handshake done)-> listening
	31		heard settings
			set TTL window width (default 2 ms)
	35		doing settings
	41		heard command
	45		doing task (triggering)
	51		heard reset

<Communication latency benchmarking>
bounce time check
given baudrate
give data size
given send_now
