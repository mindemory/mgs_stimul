function recordPhosphenes(subjID, session, TMSamp)
%% Record Phoshpenes (mrugank: 03/07/2022)
% The code has been originally written by Masih. It has been adapted to
% make changes to suitably adjust to the new display, interact with the TMS
% device using MarkStim trigger and few other changes.

% The code creates a dark stimulus display with a red fixation cross. When
% the TMS parameter is set to 1 in loadParameters(), the code interacts with
% the Teensy trigger to first initiate a handshake. Make sure that the
% orange light is turned on on the TeensyTrigger before running the code.
% If the light is not on, reset the TeensyTrigger by pressing the orange
% button.

% It then asks for a new coil location, followed by whether the coil
% location is new or the trial is new. For a new trial, it will make the
% screen black and interact with the TMS device to send a pulse that is set
% on the TMS machine. It then waits for the subject to report if phosphene
% was seen. A left mouse-click implies a phosphene was seen while a right
% mouse-click implies a phosphene was not seen. If a phosphene was seen, it
% then activates a draw tool for the subject to draw the rough borders to
% report the phosphene seen. The drawing is ended upon second left click.

% The code runs till quit (q) is pressed by the experimenter.
